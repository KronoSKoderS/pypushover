PyPushover mirrors Pushover's API for sending messages.  This means we follow the same process and have the same
requirements in order to send messages.  Mainly:

1. ``app_token`` - you registered applications token from Pushover
2. ``user_key`` or ``user_key`` - the user or group's key to send the message to

For more information about how to register your application, please visit Pushover's site (https://pushover.net/api#registration)
